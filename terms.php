            Tetris! reserves the right to modify this Agreement by
            (1) posting a revised Agreement on and/or through the Services and
            (2) providing notice to you that this Agreement has changed
            generally via email where practicable, and otherwise through the Services
            (such as through a notification on your dashboard).
            Modifications will not apply retroactively.
            You are responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications
            to this Agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
            We may sometimes ask you to review and to explicitly agree to (or reject)
            a revised version of this Agreement. In such cases, modifications will be
            effective at the time of your agreement to the modified version of this Agreement.

            but otherwise provide notice as set forth above, the modified version of this Agreement
            will become effective fourteen days after we have posted the modified Agreement
            and provided you notification of the modifications.
            Your use of the Services following that period constitutes your acceptance of the terms
            and conditions of this Agreement as modified.
